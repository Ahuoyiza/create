## Create - Intentional Growth App (Next.js)

This is the README file for the "Create" web application, a Next.js project designed to empower users with intentional growth, particularly in their careers. 

** Project Overview**

Create helps users define clear goals, create actionable daily plans, track progress, and discover relevant information to fuel their growth journey.

**Ô∏è Technologies Used**

* Next.js - React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications.


** Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/create.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a database (if using custom authentication):**

   - Follow instructions for your chosen database to set up and configure it.

4. **Configure environment variables:**

   - Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add any environment variables required for your authentication provider or database connection (refer to specific library documentation).

   **Example (.env.local):**

   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   # Add other environment variables as needed (e.g., database connection details)
   ```

5. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

** Features (MVP)**

* User accounts and login
* Goal setting with descriptions and success metrics
* Daily to-do lists categorized by work, learning, personal growth, and rest
* Mark tasks complete and carry over unfinished tasks
* Progress tracking dashboard with visual summaries
* Basic AI integration (using web scraping) for relevant content recommendations (daily email digest)
* Alerts for potential task underestimation and reminders to schedule rest

** Code Structure**

* `pages`: Contains React components for application pages
* `components`: Reusable UI components
* `api`: Server-side functionality (e.g., API routes for authentication)
* `public`: Static assets (images, fonts)

** Additional Notes**

* This is a work in progress focused on the MVP.
* Refer to the code and relevant documentation for detailed implementation specifics.
